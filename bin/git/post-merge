# Git hook to automatically execute Composer commands after a Git merge. If the file "composer.lock" was modified by the
# merge the command "composer install" is executed. If the file "composer.lock" was not modified by the merge the command
# "composer dump-autoload" is executed.
#
#
# Notes:
# ------
#  - The hook is not executed if merging failed due to conflicts.
#  - The hook is not executed if "git pull" is run with the --rebase option.
#  - If the hook is not executed automatically the Composer commands have to be called manually.
#  - Whether or not hooks are executed by a graphical Git replacement depends on the tool. For example the JGit
#    implementation of Eclipse atm does not execute hooks.
#
#
# From the Git hooks documentation:
# ---------------------------------
# This hook is invoked by git merge, which happens when a git pull is done on a local repository. The hook takes a single 
# parameter, a status flag specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge. This hook cannot affect the 
# outcome of git merge and is not executed, if the merge failed due to conflicts.
