# Git hook to automatically execute Composer commands after a Git checkout. If the file "composer.lock" was modified by the
# checkout the command "composer install" is executed. If the file "composer.lock" was not modified by the checkout the
# command "composer dump-autoload" is executed.
#
#
# Notes:
# ------
#  - If the hook is not executed automatically the Composer commands have to be called manually.
#  - Whether or not hooks are executed by a graphical Git replacement depends on the tool. For example the JGit
#    implementation of Eclipse atm does not execute hooks.
#
#
# From the Git hooks documentation:
# ---------------------------------
# This hook is invoked when a git checkout is run after having updated the worktree. The hook is given three parameters: 
# the ref of the previous HEAD, the ref of the new HEAD (which may or may not have changed), and a flag indicating whether 
# the checkout was a branch checkout (changing branches, flag=1) or a file checkout (retrieving files from the index, flag=0). 
# This hook cannot affect the outcome of git checkout.
#
# It is also run after git clone, unless the --no-checkout (-n) option is used. The first parameter given to the hook is the 
# null-ref, the second the ref of the new HEAD and the flag is always 1. Likewise for git worktree add unless --no-checkout 
# is used.
#
# This hook can be used to perform repository validity checks, auto-display differences from the previous HEAD if different, 
# or set working dir metadata properties.
